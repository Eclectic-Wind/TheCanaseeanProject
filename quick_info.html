  <h2>Welcome to Canaseëa</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Canaseëa and the greater world of Idril. This is a worldbuilding
    project managed by Kam, focusing on a Victorian-era magic steampunk setting
    brimming with intricate politics, diverse cultures, complex economics, and,
    of course, a unique magic system!
  </p>

  <h3>The World's Geography</h3>
  <p>
    Idril features broadly 9 land continents (or 8, if Canaseea is treated as a
    singular entity):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Canaseëa (often divided into Western and Eastern regions)</li>
    <li>The Dulvan Continent (comprising various component states)</li>
    <li>The Kayin Archipelagos</li>
    <li>Asdent (sometimes referred to as The New World)</li>
    <li>Other continents (details pending further development)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Magic System: Semeiographia</h3>
  <p>
    The world is distinguished by its extremely strict, hard magic system known
    as Semeiographia. In this system, science, engineering, magic, and
    philosophy intertwine. It relies on intricate glyphs and circles that
    interconnect to create complex and predictable magical effects.
